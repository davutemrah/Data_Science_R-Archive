 my first R Markdown File  
===========================
 
 This is my first Rmarkdown file (in this different style, indeed). Main difference is that I don't run the codes but I just knit the file. So you don't see the results here, but they will show up in the output file.
 
### Here goes the data
 
 ```{r}
 library(datasets)
 data(airquality)
 summary(airquality)
 ```
 
Let's first make a pairs plot of the data.
 
 ```{r}
 pairs(airquality)
 ```
 
 Here is a regression model
 ```{r}
 library(stats)
 fit <- lm(Ozone ~ Wind + Solar.R + Temp, data = airquality)
 summary(fit)
 ```
 
Here is an unordered lists  
* list1  
* list2
